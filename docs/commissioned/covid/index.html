<h2>MCC Cambodia: Aid Distribution during COVID-19 (2020)</h2>
					These drawings are part of a COVID-related MCC Cambodia project that is working to help make food aid distribution safer and more socially-distanced. The diagrams show how this distribution should and should not look, as well as the different, spaced stages that there would be in a safe distribution system.<br/><br/>Here is the <a href="/COVID_SOP_Food_Assistance.pdf" target="_blank">Standard Operating Procedure</a> that these images were based upon.
